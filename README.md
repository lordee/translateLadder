# translateLadder
.Net core program to translate hitachi logic to logix5000 ladder code for industrial automation.  Not all opcodes are translated, but most are. I converted a ~7k loc file from one to another with this without any issues.  

Use as you see fit, I have put it up here in the hope of saving someone the hours of poring over manuals and no machines to test on.

This code is not cleanly formatted, it was done as fast as possible.


first100.csv is an example of the input and first100.l5x is an example of the translated ladder code.
